SciPy 2014 Proposals
===================

Carson Farmer's proposals for SciPy 2014.

1. Paper: Light-Weight Real-Time Event Detection with Python
2. Tutorial: Geospatial Data in Python: Database, Desktop, and the Web

General theme is Python for Geospatial Data. More specifically, I focus on using Python as a light-weight glue to bind data from online sources &rarr; analytical workflows on the desktop or server &rarr; diseminating results via the web.
